## A Framework for Causal Inference for Multiple Mediators

The objective of this article is to introduce a new framework for inference about direct and indirect effects in the setting of multiple mediators. In particular, we decompose the joint indirect effect of all the mediators into each individual indirect effect, pairwise effects, etc. Possible identifying assumptions (with corresponding sensitivity parameters) are discussed. The framework is illustrated on the STRlDE data (Marcus et a!., 2007a,b) which is a 4-year randomized trial examining the efficacy of interventions (telephone-based and print-based group vs. contact group) on physical activity adoption. With nl = 161 participants in the intervention arm and no = 78 in the control arm, this paper illustrates an approach to measure the simultaneous effects of three psychosocial mediators (self-efficacy, behavior process and cognitive process scores at months 6) on total weekly minutes of moderate intensity physical activity at 12 months. We implement the BART method to flexibly estimate the observed data model.
